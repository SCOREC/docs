\opening{Dear Editor,}

We are submitting for review our recent work on hybrid MPI-thread parallelism
applied to unstructured, adaptive mesh simulations.
This research has been ongoing for over a year, resulting in the development
of a highly stable and scalable hybrid communications library called PCU, which is actively
supporting the SCOREC mesh adaptation tools at RPI and, in turn, the PHASTA fluid solver
from the University of Colorado Boulder
and the Albany solver framework from Sandia National Laboratories.
PCU continues to demonstrate scaling on IBM Blue Gene/Q machines.

The technology in PCU consists of a system of non-blocking inter-thread message
passing primitives, non-blocking threaded collectives, and a termination
detection algorithm which optimally solves a communication problem often
encountered in parallel unstructured mesh simulations.

The maturity of this work coincides with the current activity in the HPC
community on the subject of hybrid programming models and systems.
It should interest the readers of Parallel Computing how PCU attains
hybrid MPI-thread
scalability for general and unpredictable communication patterns using
simple yet novel algorithms.

We look forward to working with you.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
