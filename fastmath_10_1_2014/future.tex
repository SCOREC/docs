\frame{\frametitle{Concerns About Systems with Heterogeneous Nodes}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Multiple seperate memory domains on each node?
\item Limited accelerator-host bandwidth?
\item Different programming model for the accelerator?
\item Limited accelerator threads?
\item Multiple software threads per hardware thread?
\item Efficient MPI support?
\end{itemize}
... a homogeneous system of GP-GPU like nodes would also be concerning
