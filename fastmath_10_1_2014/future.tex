\begin{itemize}
\item Will future machines have limited 
accelerator-host bandwidth ?
\item Will future machines have many pieces to program
(accelerator + host + even more) ?
\item Will future machines have limited accelerator
threads (like GPUs which run in lock-step) ?
\item Will future machines allow multiple software
threads per hardware thread ?
\item Will future machines support MPI at
the accelerator level ?
\end{itemize}
