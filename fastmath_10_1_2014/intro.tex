\frame{\frametitle{Capabilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel Unstructured Meshes
\begin{itemize}
\item Triangular, tetrahedral, mixed tetrahedral
with prismatic boundary layers
\end{itemize}
\item General Adaptivity - not just refinement
\begin{itemize}
\item Constant insertion/removal of mesh entities
\item Local cavity operations, possibly overlapping
\item Many conditionals per cavity
\end{itemize}
\item Dynamic Partitioning (ParMA)
\begin{itemize}
\item Reacts to mesh changes in adaptivity
\item Diffusive algorithms for scalability
\item Constant migration of mesh entities
\item Constant change of communication pattern
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Approach}
\begin{itemize}
\item Define an abstract model similar to MPI:
ranks that pass messages
\item Adapt it beyond processes (e.g. to threads)
\item Define a subset of communication patterns
(collectives) that can be more optimally implemented
\item Use the restrictions on communication patterns
to reduce abstraction overhead
\item Use this communication model for all code
\item Architecture-specific code contained in communication
library
\end{itemize}
