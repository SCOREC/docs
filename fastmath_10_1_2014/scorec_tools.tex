\frame{\frametitle{PCU Communication}
\begin{itemize}
\item Local, collective, unstructured exchanges
\item Buffer all messages between each pair
\item Non-blocking send/receive
\item Non-blocking barrier (!) for termination detection
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{PCU Threading}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create/join through pthread
\item Uniform threads per process
\item Communication between threads
\item Use MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE
\item Buffering between pairs reduces contention
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Role of Threads}
\begin{itemize}
\item Treated like nested \texttt{mpiexec}
\item All threads have globally unique ranks
\item Communcation primitives and high-level operations
using thread ranks
\item Thread has 3D contiguous mesh partition
\end{itemize}
