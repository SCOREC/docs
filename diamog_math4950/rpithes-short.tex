\specialhead{ABSTRACT}
Massively parallelized mesh simulations require the mesh to be distributed
throughout many processes(parts) and be balanced in terms of computation and
communicaion. 
Many algorithms exist that target having an equal number mesh entities of a
specified dimension on each part. 
The most powerful of these, in terms of partition quality and runtime are the
multi-level (hyper)graph-based methods and the recusive geometric sectioning
methods. 
Multi-level (hyper)graph methods describe the mesh in terms of graph nodes and
(hyper)edges and then use a v-cycle of coarsening followed by un-coarsening to
divide the graph into subgraphs while recursive sectioning geometric methods use
a coordinate system such as the cartesian location or centroids to recursivly
section the mesh along coordinate or inertial axis. 
The faster geometric methods tend to create parts that have large inter-part
surface area, and many neighbors relative to the (hyper)graph based methods
which causes an increase in communication.
(Hyper)Graph-based methods can also suffer from similar issues as the number of
parts gets very large and the number of elements per part drops to several
hundreds. 
An alternative method that uses mesh data directly, ParMA, performs load 
balancing without the need to construct a graph. 
With access to all the mesh, partition, and model data, including topological 
and geometric coordinates, partitioning methods analogous to those used by 
(hyper)graph and geometric based procedures can be defined.
Towards this, ParMA paritioning methods will be extended to improve the overall 
shape of a part in order to reduce the number of neighbors each part has and 
thus reduce application communication times.

\section{Motivation}
In various applications it is important to reduce the average number of neighbors
a part has. If parts share boundaries with many neighbors there will be lots of 
time spent sending and receiving information from each part's neighbors.

\chapter{Related Works}

Many different distributed methods to balance unstructured meshes have been explored in the 
past \cite{multidiffuse,surveygraph}. Here we discuss the three most commonly 
used methods: diffusive, hypergraph, and multilevel.

\section{Diffusive load balancing}
Willebeek-LeMair and Reeves describe diffusive load balancing techniques with 
4 steps \cite{loadbalance}. The first is evaluating the processor load, then 
determining the profitability of the load balancing, followed by a task 
migration strategy, and finally a task selection strategy. They review over 5 
different strategies and how they perform on the second and thrid task. The first 
method reviewed was the Sender Initiated Diffusion method (SID). This method 
restricts parts to only communicate with their neighbors and the heavy parts or 
senders are the migration selectors. The second technique is similar to the first 
and called Reciever Initiated Diffusion (RID). Once again parts can only 
communicate with their neighbors, but instead of the heavy parts selecting 
migration targets, the light parts select heavier neighbors to recieve load from. 
Our method for shape optimization is similar to the idea of a RID method. In the 
Gradient Method (GM), light parts inform nearby parts in search of a heavy part 
which causes heavy parts to send load towards the closest light part. The 
Hierarchial Balancing Method (HBM) breaks up load balancing into a hierarchy of 
parts and performs load balancing at a low level and then continues to balance 
while moving up a hierarchy. The final method is the Dimmension Exchange Method
 (DEM). Similar to the HBM, the DEM approach balances at a low level and works 
up, but the DEM balances synchronously in all dimensions one at a time.

\section{(Hyper)graph methods}
Graph and Hypergraph load balancing methods use an abstraction of the mesh in 
order to balance the work load between processes. \cite{surveygraph} gives an
overview of graph methods in the field for both graphs and hypergraphs. They 
also discuss the challenges and NP-hardness of many of the algorithms for graph
balancing. Two terms that are used to model the overall shape for graph methods
are the edge cut and communication volume. The authors show that communication
volume is a better measurement which leads to hypergraph methods which target 
the communication volume using hyperedges. Devine et al. discuss methods 
to use hypergraphs for parallel scientific computing \cite{hypergraph}. They
use hypergraphs to accurately represent communication volume and as a result
part neighbors. The hypergraph method uses hyperedges or nets which connects 
several vertices in the graph that may be on different parts. Therefore 
balancing a hypergraph naturally puts an effort towards balancing the overall
shape and neighbors of parts. 

\section{Multilevel methods}
Buluc et al. descirbe the multilevel methods as the most successful approach to 
graph partitioning \cite{surveygraph}. They descirbe multilevel methods generally 
as a 3 step process that start with coarsening the mesh until it reaches a small 
level then an inital partition or balance of the graph or mesh is made and finally
a step of working back up balancing at each level to progressively refine the 
load balance as the mesh is rebuilt. This general design allows for most 
algorithms to be altered to work in a multilevel form. Meyerhenke et al. 
port a diffusive method previously used for shape optimization into a 
multilevel algorithm \cite{multidiffuse}. They use the multilevel structure in 
order to use the expensive but more effective balancing portion of the 
algorithm, Bubble-FOS/C, when at a small level and then do small refinements, 
TruncCons, when at the larger levels of the load balancer. This method was 
shown to be much faster than the original method of just the Bubble-FOS/C and 
also produces a better quality of load balancing.
