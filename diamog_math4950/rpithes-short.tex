\specialhead{ABSTRACT}
Massively parallelized mesh simulations require the mesh to be distributed
throughout many processes(parts) and be balanced in terms of computation and
communicaion. 
Many algorithms exist that target having an equal number mesh entities of a
specified dimension on each part. 
The most powerful of these, in terms of partition quality and runtime are the
multi-level (hyper)graph-based methods and the recusive geometric sectioning
methods. 
Multi-level (hyper)graph methods describe the mesh in terms of graph nodes and
(hyper)edges and then use a v-cycle of coarsening followed by un-coarsening to
divide the graph into subgraphs while recursive sectioning geometric methods use
a coordinate system such as the cartesian location or centroids to recursivly
section the mesh along coordinate or inertial axis. 
The faster geometric methods tend to create parts that have large inter-part
surface area, and many neighbors relative to the (hyper)graph based methods
which causes an increase in communication.
(Hyper)Graph-based methods can also suffer from similar issues as the number of
parts gets very large and the number of elements per part drops to several
hundreds. 
An alternative method that uses mesh data directly, ParMA, performs load 
balancing without the need to construct a graph. 
With access to all the mesh, partition, and model data, including topological 
and geometric coordinates, partitioning methods analogous to those used by 
(hyper)graph and geometric based procedures can be defined.
Towards this, ParMA paritioning methods will be extended to improve the overall 
shape of a part in order to reduce the number of neighbors each part has and 
thus reduce application communication times.

\chapter{Related Works}

Many different distributed methods to balance unstructured meshes have been explored in the 
past. Here we discuss the three most commonly used methods: diffusive, hypergraph, 
and multilevel.

\section{Diffusive load balancing}
Willebeek-LeMair and Reeves describe diffusive load balancing techniques with 
4 steps \cite{loadbalance}. The first is evaluating the processor load, then 
determining the profitability of the load balancing, followed by a task 
migration strategy, and finally a task selection strategy. They review over 5 
different strategies and how they perform on the second and thrid task. The first 
method reviewed was the Sender Initiated Diffusion method (SID). This method 
restricts parts to only communicate with their neighbors and the heavy parts or 
senders are the migration selectors. The second technique is similar to the first 
and called Reciever Initiated Diffusion (RID). Once again parts can only 
communicate with their neighbors, but instead of the heavy parts selecting 
migration targets, the light parts select heavier neighbors to recieve load from. 
Our method for shape optimization is similar to the idea of a RID method. In the 
Gradient Method (GM), light parts inform nearby parts in search of a heavy part 
which causes heavy parts to send load towards the closest light part. The 
Hierarchial Balancing Method (HBM) breaks up load balancing into a hierarchy of 
parts and performs load balancing at a low level and then continues to balance 
while moving up a hierarchy. The final method is the Dimmension Exchange Method
 (DEM). Similar to the HBM, the DEM approach balances at a low level and works 
up, but the DEM balances synchronously in all dimensions one at a time.
